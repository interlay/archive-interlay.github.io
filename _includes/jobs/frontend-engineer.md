We are looking for a frontend engineer to help us implement Interlay's cross-chain communication platform. 

The current design revolves around a trustless Bitcoin-[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) bridge that will serve as the main gateway for bringing Bitcoin liquidity into Polkadot's ecosystem. Polkadot, developed by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/) and the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), is one of the industry's flagship blockchains and has raised over USD 150 million. 
The underlying framework follows a [detailed specification](https://interlay.gitlab.io/polkabtc-spec/index.html) and is based on the [XCLAIM paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643.pdf), published at the top-tier security conference IEEE S&amp;P. In parallel, we are building a trustless &amp; non-custodial trading platform for cross-chain derivatives, with a focus on Bitcoin. 

Your task will be to design and build the web-based user interface using **React** and **TypeScript** for (i) the cross-chain communication framework and (ii) the trustless trading platform. Thereby, you will connect the frontend to the Polkadot and Ethereum blockchains via REST/RPC, and design usable integrations into Bitcoin (web) wallets.  

You will need to have an excellent understanding of React and TypeScript best practices and experience with writing production-ready software (incl. E2E testing). Experience with development in blockchain-based environments is strongly encouraged, as you will need a basic understanding of the underlying technology to build user flows and simplify interactions without loss of security. Knowledge of standardized &amp; responsive CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap, is beneficial.

*Full-time and preferably based in the UK*

**What you will do**
* Build a React + TypeScript frontend for a trustless cross-chain asset transfer &amp; derivative trading framework. 
* Connect to blockchains wallets, including Bitcoin, Polkadot, and Ethereum. 
* Contribute to other open-source projects that we integrate with
* Help design simple user flows for complex technical processes
* Work in close collaboration with the founders on preparing product demos

**What you bring**
* Expertise in React and TypeScript
* Experience in creating and deploying usable, production-ready applications
* Experience with delelopment in blockchain-based environments (Bitcoin / Ethereum)
* Passion for secure and well-tested software
* Desire to learn and work with bleeding-edge technology
* BSc/MSc degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent experience
* Proficiency in English (and/or German)

**"Nice to have"**
* Understanding of asynchronous programming
* Understanding of financial products (options, futures, swaps)

**Benefits and Perks**
* Stock options
* Remote working
* Travel to international blockchain conferences
* Allowance for a co-working space
* Yearly retreat
