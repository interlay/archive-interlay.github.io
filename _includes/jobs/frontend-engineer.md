We are looking for a frontend engineer to help us implement  [PolkaBTC](https://medium.com/interlay/bitcoin-on-polkadot-proof-of-concept-for-trustless-bridge-shipped-6fb8e549bef0). 

The PolkaBTC bridge connects Bitcoin with the Polkadot ecosystem in a trustless and decentralized manner and will serve as the main gateway for bringing BTC liquidity into Polkadot’s DeFi ecosystem. The design is based on [top tier academic research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643) and the implementation follows our [detailed specification](https://interlay.gitlab.io/polkabtc-spec/index.html). The project is funded by a [Web3 Foundation grant](https://web3.foundation/).

Your task will be to help with the design of the web-based UI and build the UI using React, Redux, and TypeScript for PolkaBTC. An [initial demo](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/polkadefi-conference) of the app shows what we have in mind. You will need to have an excellent understanding of React and TypeScript best practices and experience with writing production-ready software (incl. E2E testing). Experience with development in blockchain-based environments is strongly encouraged, as you will need a basic understanding of the underlying technology to build user flows and simplify interactions without loss of security. Knowledge of standardized and responsive CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap, is beneficial.
