We are looking for a UI/UX designer with a background in front-end engineering to help us with our two products, XOpts and PolkaBTC. The [PolkaBTC bridge](https://medium.com/interlay/bitcoin-on-polkadot-proof-of-concept-for-trustless-bridge-shipped-6fb8e549bef0) connects Bitcoin with the Polkadot ecosystem in a trustless and decentralized manner and will serve as the main gateway for bringing BTC liquidity into Polkadot’s DeFi ecosystem. [XOpts](https://xopts.io/) is a trustless and non-custodial platform for cross-chain BTC options - currently built on top of Ethereum. Both platforms are built at the hotspot of current innovation in the blockchain space.

Your task will be to help with the design of the web-based UI for both platforms. Further, you will implement components for the PolkaBTC side in SCSS, React/Redux, and TypeScript. The current version of XOpts is live on the Ropsten testnet. We also have an initial demo of the PolkaBTC app that shows what we have in mind. 

You will need to have a strong focus on design and clean user interfaces. Your role will give you the freedom to propose new designs and quickly iterate those with the rest of the team. Ideally, you also have a good understanding of React and TypeScript best practices and experience with writing production-ready software (incl. E2E testing). Experience with development in blockchain-based environments is strongly encouraged, as you will need a basic understanding of the underlying technology to build user flows and simplify interactions without loss of security.
