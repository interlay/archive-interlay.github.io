We are looking for a (senior) Rust software engineer to help us implement Interlay's cross-chain communication platform. The current design revolves around a trustless Bitcoin-[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) bridge that will serve as the main gateway for bringing Bitcoin liquidity into Polkadot's ecosystem. Polkadot, developed by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/) and the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), is one of the industry's flagship projects and has raised over USD 150 million. 

The implementation follows a [detailed specification](https://interlay.gitlab.io/polkabtc-spec/index.html) and is based on the [XCLAIM paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643.pdf), published at the top-tier security conference IEEE S&amp;P. In parallell, we are building a trustless &amp; non-custodial trading platform for cross-chain derivatives, with a focus on Bitcoin. 

Your task will be to extend and improve the existing architecture ([Github repo](https://github.com/interlay/BTC-Parachain)), developed in Rust using Party's [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/) framework. In parallel, you will aid with the design and implementation of the trustless derivative trading platform, diving into high performance computing. 
You will need to have an excellent understanding of Rust best practices and experience with writing production-ready software. Apart from development work, you will have the opportunity to closely work with us on advancing the state of blockchain interoperability, contributing to research on novel cryptographic protocols for efficient blockchain light clients and interoperable payment channels.

*Full-time and preferably based in the UK*

**What you will do**

* Work in close collaboration with the founders on project planning and strategic technical decisions

**What you bring**
* Experience in creating and deploying production-ready applications
* Passion for secure software (specifically in Rust)
* Desire to learn and work with bleeding-edge technology
* Strategic decision making and analytical skills for long-term technological decisions
* BSc/MSc degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent experience
* Proficiency in English (and/or German)

**"Nice to have"**
* In-depth understanding of Bitcoin (consensus, data structures, security model)
* Prior experience with the Substrate Rust framework
* Prior experience with Solidity or Vyper (Ethereum)

**Benefits and Perks**
* Stock options
* Remote working
* Travel to international blockchain conferences
* Allowance for a co-working space
