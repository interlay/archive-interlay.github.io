We are looking for a software engineer to help us implement [PolkaBTC](https://medium.com/interlay/bitcoin-on-polkadot-proof-of-concept-for-trustless-bridge-shipped-6fb8e549bef0). 

The PolkaBTC bridge connects Bitcoin with the Polkadot ecosystem in a trustless and decentralized manner and will serve as the main gateway for bringing BTC liquidity into Polkadot’s DeFi ecosystem. The design is based on [top tier academic research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643) and the implementation follows our [detailed specification](https://interlay.gitlab.io/polkabtc-spec/index.html). The project is funded by a [Web3 Foundation grant](https://web3.foundation/).

Your task will be to implement new modules as well as test and improve our current [proof-of-concept implementation](https://gitlab.com/interlay/btc-parachain) of PolkaBTC to ensure it is production-ready software in collaboration with our software engineering team. Additionally, you will write CLI-based clients that can interact with PolkaBTC. To get a better idea of what the final product should look like, check out our [initial demo](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/polkadefi-conference) of the app.

The Substrate-based blockchain, as well as our CLI clients, are written in Rust. You will need to have an excellent understanding of at least one programming language (e.g. Rust/C/C++/Go) and experience with writing production-ready software (incl. E2E testing). Experience with development in blockchain-based environments and/or distributed systems is strongly encouraged, as you will need a basic understanding of the underlying technology to ensure the security of the system in a decentralized and open environment.

*Full-time and preferably based in the UK*

**What you will do**

- Implement and test an open-source Rust (Substrate) bridge for creating Bitcoin-backed assets on Polkadot (PolkaBTC)
- Implement and test open-source clients in Rust that interact with Bitcoin and Polkadot
- Enhance our current testing setup from simple unit tests to integration and fuzz testing
- Collaborate with the other team members to ensure that we deliver the software in time and according to the specification
- Improve the design of the bridge with respect to runtime performance and security
- Contribute to other open-source projects that we integrate with 

**What you bring**

- Experience in creating and deploying production-ready applications in a language such as Rust/C/C++/Go
- Experience with testing strategies and testing frameworks
- Understanding of distributed/decentralized computing
- Passion for secure software (specifically in Rust)
- Desire to learn and work with bleeding-edge technology
- BSc/MSc degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent experience
- Proficiency in English

**“Nice to have”**

- In-depth understanding of Bitcoin (consensus, data structures, security model)
- Open-source contributions to a Rust-based project
- Prior experience with the Substrate Rust framework

**Benefits and Perks**
* Stock options
* Remote working
* Flexible working hours
* Yearly retreat
* Open-source software
