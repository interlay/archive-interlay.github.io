We are hiring a senior web3 full-stack engineer to help us build Interlay’s decentralized cross-chain settlement layer. Your initial focus will be on [XOpts](https://xopts.io/) and implementing physically settled Bitcoin [OTC options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcoptions.asp) on Ethereum. 

Your responsibility will be to implement state-of-the-art smart contracts, ensuring security best practices and a modular design to ensure extensibility. You will be in charge of building an open-source TS library for smart contract interactions, integrated into the React web app. Your previous experience in React, Redux, Next.js and Bootstrap will help us make the app usable and reliable.

As an ideal candidate, you have previously worked on open-source production grade software, especially on EVM smart contracts. You are excited about the challenges of coding in decentralized environments and are ready to dig into low-level implementation details. You also have experience with Bitcoin, UTXOs and transaction scripts. 

You will be joining an ambitious team with multi-year expertise in blockchain protocols, security and cryptography. There will be a steep learning curve, we will expect you to stay up to date with technological developments, and you will be encouraged to apply your ideas to product designs.
