          <h3>About Interlay</h3>
          At Interlay, we envision a future where permissioned and permissionless blockchains, regardless of design and
          purpose, can seamlessly connect and interact. Our goal is to enable users and businesses to easily use their
          preferred digital currency across all blockchain platforms: in DeFi loans, on decentralized exchanges, as
          payments in layer-2 protocols, or to interact with application-specific ledgers on Polkadot and Cosmos.

          <br>
          <br>
          At Interlay, we are building a trustless blockchain interoperability layer, stemming from cutting-edge
          research: XCLAIM, the first framework for financially trustless blockchain interoperability.

          We are a young team of leading experts in blockchain security and interoperability and have been hacking and
          producing top tier research in the blockchain space for the past 5 years.

          We are distributed across London (UK), Vienna (Austria), and Tokyo (Japan).
