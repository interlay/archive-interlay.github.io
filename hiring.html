      <h3>About Interlay</h3>
      With the increasing number of blockchains, different in design and purpose, it is unlikely that "one chain will rule them all". As a result, cross-blockchain communication has emerged as one of the major challenges in this space: it is fundamental to cryptocurrency exchanges, scaling blockchains via sharding, as well as bootstrapping and extension of new/existing systems.

      <br>
      <br>
      At Interlay, we are building a trustless blockchain interoperability layer, stemming from cutting edge research in this field. Our goal is to preserve the decentralized nature of the interconnected blockchains while providing users and applications with access to any digital asset, on any blockchain platform. To this end, we designed XCLAIM, the first framework for financially trustless blockchain interoperability (published at a top tier academic security conference). 
      We are a young team of leading experts in blockchain security and interoperability, who have been producing top tier blockchain and security research for the past 5 years.

            We are looking for a (senior) software engineer to help us implement a bridge from Bitcoin to Polkadot, one of the largest industry blockchain projects in this space. The bridge is being implemented in Rust (using the Substrate framework), following on a detailed specification of XCLAIM - developed in close collaboration with the teams behind Polkadot. The entire codebase and specification is open source.
            <br>
            <br>
          Your task is to implement the Bitcoin bridge on Polkadot in Rust/Substrate, including modules for verifying the Bitcoin blockchain and creating/managing Bitcoin-backed assets. 
          You will need to have an excellent understanding of Rust best practices and experience with writing production-ready software. Apart from development work, you will have the chance to closely work with us on advancing the state of blockchain interoperability, contributing to research on novel cryptographic protocols for efficient blockchain light clients and interoperable payment channels.
